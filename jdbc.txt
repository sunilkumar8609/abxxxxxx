	public boolean execute(String sql)        ==>  DDL and DML
	public int executeUpdate(String sql)      ==> Only for DML
	public ResultSet executeQuery(String sql) ==> DQL
	public int[] executeBatch()               ==>DML


==>for DML command prefer to use only executeUpdate(), why because it's returns how many records are inserted or
deleted.

==>multi number of DML command than use executeBatch();
